# A mirror of the Git mailing list

This is actually a mirror of the Git mailing list mirror at https://lore.kernel.org/git. Since that mirror chunks the archive by epochs, this mirror fetches each epoch into its own branch: the oldest epoch into `lore-0`, the next one into `lore-1`, etc.

As scheduled workflows _must_ live in the default branch, this mirror's main branch is the one containing the workflow, this `README.md` and nothing else.
